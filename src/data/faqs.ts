    question: "History behind the club",
    answer: `
      The idea of starting an Astronomy club struck one of the founders on Himalaya block terrace 
      where <a class="custom-link" href="https://sites.google.com/view/praveen-paruchuri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Praveen Paruchuri</a> 
      had invited everyone to witness the "Super Blue Blood Moon" - the lunar eclipse on 31st January 2018.

      decided to take this idea seriously and mailed <a class="custom-link" href="https://sites.google.com/site/subhadipmitra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Subhadip Mitra</a> 
      for support/mentorship. His reply? He was waiting for someone in the college to take interest in this field. 
      <br/><br/>
      With a lot of efforts and support from <a class="custom-link" href="https://sites.google.com/site/radhika41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Radhika Mamidi</a>, 
      then the SLC chair, an 8 inch Dobosonian reflector telescope was procured in our first year. We formally started our Club by holding a 
      total lunar eclipse viewing session on 27th July 2018 – the start of the new academic year and our club as well! 
      <br/><br/>
      The club expanded its focus to include SpaceTech, leading to notable achievements in 2021 and 2024, 
      where our teams reached the World Finals of the prestigious CanSat Competition. In July 2024, 
      the club was officially renamed as <i>Astronautics Club</i>, reflecting our expanded vision and aspirations.

    question: "I'm interested in learning about Astronomy and Astrophysics. Where do I start learning from?",
    answer: `
      A good beginning point is the <b>Cosmic Distance Ladder</b> which covers how distances in space are measured. 
      We wrote an article for the same <a class="custom-link" href="https://clubs.iiit.ac.in/astronautics/blogs/cosmic-distance-ladder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>
