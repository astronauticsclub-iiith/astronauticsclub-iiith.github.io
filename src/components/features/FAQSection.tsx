        the halt in the club&apos;s expansion due to COVID. <br />

        Around this time, India&apos;s space sector was witnessing a remarkable
        boom, marked by the emergence of multiple SpaceTech startups and the
        successful Chandrayaan-3 mission. Riding this wave of enthusiasm, the
        club expanded its focus to include SpaceTech, leading to notable
        achievements in 2021 and 2024, when our teams reached the World Finals
        of the prestigious CanSat Competitionâ€”a miniature satellite design
        competition organized by the American Astronautical Society and NASA. In
        July 2024, the club was officially renamed as <i>Astronautics Club</i>,
        reflecting our expanded vision and aspirations.
